    "An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is a special case of linear models where we are interested in the effetcs of one numerical continuous explanatory variable and one categorical explanatory variable and their interaction. The response/depdendent variable is still a numerical variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "An ANCOVA is also used in slightly different instance where we want to control for the effects of some continuous variable while assessing the difference between some categorical variable of interest. Imagine trying to determine the effects of some treatment on the growth of an organism, but the organisms are at different sizes at the start. An ANCOVA would try to compare the means of the treatment while controlling for the different initial sizes. \n",
